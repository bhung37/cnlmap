                    The Chinese Nationalist League of Canada (CNLOC) Victoria Branch is one of the oldest branch in Canada. The branch was operating 
                    as the 交通部 when founded to support revolutionists and supplies moving between Pasific ocean. After the Republic of China was founded, 
                    it re-branded into local oversea branch in Canada.

                    <br>
                    After the kidnap incident in London, UK, Dr Sun Yat Sen traveling from Europe to Canada and planning to return to Asia. Dr. Sun landed in Victoria
                    on July 20th, 1897. Because of the Chinatown church (美以美教會) pastor 陳陞階 hosted the reciption, Dr. Sun was able to interactive with church members
                    and promoting the revolution idea until Aust 2nd evening boarded the cruise ship to Honolulu. One of the most important event during the first time visit 
                    was the meeting with Chinese shop's (英昌隆號) owners 李英燦 and 李進; the shop on the Comorant st later on became the the first relovation promoting spot in 
                    Victoria. According to the record, the first Chinese Canadian that joined the relovationist group Chinese Nationalist League was 李伯海, son of the Vicotria Chinese Canadian merchant 李福基. 
                    <br/><br>
                    In 1906, the Victoria branch was offically founded, known as 維城交通部 under direct supervision of the headquator in Shanghai. It is the first Chinese Nationalist League branch in Canada.
                    Inspired by the CNL ideology, a group of Chinese youth (吳紫桓、李翰屏、方幹謙、司徒旄(英石)、徐子樂、黃希純、黃用英、吳俠(尚鷹)、黃蔚生) in Victoria organized similiar revolutionists group called 擊楫社. 
                    Instead of focusing on CNL internal work like 交通部, 擊楫社 started to promote revolution idea in Victoria Chinese community and encourged Chinese oversea to join the revolution. However, the 擊楫社 only 
                    operated 2 years due to short funded and members struggling to live. In 1909, one of the high ranked members 馮自由 traveling from Japan to Vicotira and joined the Hongmen Victoria branch; using the 
                    secret society as the base to recruit CNL members; many of the Hongmen members also joined the CNL. He was also the main force behind Dr. Sun second Canada visit, which happened in 1910. 
                    <br><br>
                    In February 18th, 1911, Dr. Sun visited Victoria Chinatown, accompanied by 馮自由、陳文錫、黃壁峰、岑發琛, after travelling from U.S to Vancouver and stayed at the New England Hotel on Government St. He 
                    was hosting a speech at the Chinese theatre on Comorant St and attended the receiption hosted by Victoria local 李經方、馬傑瑞、蕭根隸、古文宇 at 668 Herald St. During the visit, Vicotira Chee Kung Tong sold its 
                    branch office for 30,000 dollars to support revolution; out of 77,000 dollars fund from North America for the second Guangzhou uprising in April, 1911, around 60,000 was from Canada.
